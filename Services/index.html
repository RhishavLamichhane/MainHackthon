                <h2>A travel card, often referred to as a "smart card" in Nepal, can be used to board buses, microbuses, and local city taxis
                    <img src="card.png" alt="" width="200px" class="r3">  Smart cards can be used to make purchases instead of cash because they can be loaded. You can go to any ticket counter at a bus stop or transportation facility in Nepal to obtain a smart card. A passport-sized photo and a registration form must be submitted. The transportation provider and the deposit sum will determine the card's initial cost.
                        <br><br>
                        It is important to remember that not all areas of Nepal have access to the smart card system because it has not yet been fully established there. Although it is still uncommon, it is a practical choice for tourists who intend to utilize public transportation regularly. The use of these travel cards by children will be more effective. They will find it simpler to employ them.

                        Travel cards for children can be prepaid cards that are loaded with a fixed amount of money by parents or guardians. The card can be used like a regular debit card for transactions such as booking travel tickets, paying for meals or shopping. Parents can monitor the transactions made using the card and can also set limits on the amount that can be spent by the child.Travel cards can also teach children about the value of money and budgeting skills as they will need to plan and manage their expenses during travel. It can also help them understand the importance of saving money and prioritizing expenses.
